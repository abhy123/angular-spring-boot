# Employee Portal App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

- Build and deploy this using ng serve.

- The Employee Portal App looks like the image Employee Portal.jpg

- I had earlier built a provider search/insurance platform then later also added employee portal, hence you will find both the code together. Just go through and play with the user interface, there is a lot to learn like routing, communication between components, building css and html and Using Angular libraries and make http requests and communicating with the Spring Boot Java app.
