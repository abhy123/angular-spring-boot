# Employee Portal App

- Build and deploy as a spring boot app.

- Two main starting points here - ProviderController and EmployeeController

- I had earlier built a provider search/insurance platform then later also
  added employee portal, hence you will find both the code together. 
  Just go through and play with the user interface, there is a lot to learn like 
  routing, communication between components, building css and html and Using 
  Angular libraries and make http requests and communicating with the 
  Spring Boot Java app.
